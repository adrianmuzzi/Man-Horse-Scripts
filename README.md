# Man-Horse-Scripts
I plan for this to  be a repository of PowerShell scripts I have developed to shave milliseconds off of the time it takes me to do something at work.
They are all named for Horses who have raced in the Melbourne Cup.

## [Acrasia](./Acrasia/)
Edge Profile Managment and admin shortcuts. *(CLI)*

## [Cross Counter](./CrossCounter/)
*Cross Counter* is for performing admin tasks with the MgGraph powershell module. *(CLI)*
At a glance:
 - Quickly access user accounts with a TAP
 - Reset user passwords.
 - Edit user profile information such as name/location/phone number/email etc.
 - Edit users' M365 group memberships.
 - Make profile changes to *all* the users in a tenant at once.

 ## [Rimfire](./Rimfire/)
*Rimfire* is for interacting with HaloPSA, and integrating other APIs, such as OpenAI, Pax8, MsGraph, etc. *(CLI)*

## [HiJinx](./HiJinx/)
*HiJinx* rips account login data from Chrome, Edge and most other Chromium browsers.

## [Duais](./Duais/)
*Duais* backs up a specified file in one location, and replaces it with another.

## [Protectionist](./Protectionist/)
*Protectionist* generates M365-friendly user passwords.

## [Newhaven](./Newhaven/)
*Newhaven* is an Edge browser extension.

## [Still in Development:](./Dev/)
*All* of the scripts in this repo are 'still in development'. But the ones in the 'Dev' folder are particularly rubbish.
