# Cross Counter

*Cross Counter* is for making fast changes to users in a Microsoft 365 tenant. It utilises the MgGraph powershell module. If you do not have this module, it will prompt you for install.

A web browser will then be launched with a Microsoft login prompt.

## 'Main Menu' commands

The `MAIN MENU` is the highest level menu in Cross Counter. Upon first singing into the tenant with Cross Counter, you are prompted with a fresh user list and this main menu.

-  ### Enter the number listed next to the user you wish to edit
 Leads to the *Edit User* menu for the user selected from the user list.

 **Note:** You can also type the desired user's name (or just enough of the name to be discernable) and CrossCounter will bring up the user who matches your search.

- ### all
Leads to the *Edit All Users* menu.

- ### groups
Leads to the *Groups* menu.

- ### new
Leads to the *New User* menu.

- ### users
Leads to the *List Users* menu.

- ### q
'q' In the main menu will sign out of MgGraph and exit powershell.

## 'Edit User' menu
This menu allows for quick changes to a chosen user in the tenant.
- [1.] Edit User Profile
  - *See below*
- [2.] Reset User Password
  - This option enables you choose a new password from a list of presets, *or* input a custom password. Users will be prompted to change this password on next sign-in.
- [3.] TAP Into User Account
  - This will create a new one-time-use **T**emporary **A**ccess **P**assword; valid for the user for the next 60 minutes. It also copies both the user's email and the TAP to the clipboard, and opens a new Edge private window to portal.office.com for convenient sign-in to the user's account.
- [4.] Enable/Disable Account
  - This will toggle "sign-in enabled" for the selected user's account.
- [5.] Off board user
  - This will run the user through an automated off boarding script.
- [Q.] Go back

### *Edit User Profile:*
- [1] Display Name: *
- [2] First Name: *
- [3] Last Name: *
- [4] Job Title: *
- [5] Mobile Phone *
- [6] Business Phone *
- [7] Email Address *
- [8] Department
- [9] Street address
- [10] City
- [11] Postal Code
- [12] Country
- [13] Company Name

**shows preview*

These options are fairly self explanatory. There is some extra functionality for:
- **Display Name**
  - Editing the Display name will prompt you to change the 'First Name' and 'Last Name' options to match.
- **Email**
  - Changing a user's email presents you with a list of preset options that utilise the 'First Name' and 'Last Name' profile items of the user. It also allows for custom input. ***Note:** This does not change the user's principal name (UPN)*.

## 'Edit All' menu
The 'Edit All' commands apply  to all the users in the tenant.
- [1] Company Name
- [2] Department
- [3] Street address
- [4] City
- [5] Postal Code
- [6] Country

After a change is input, the script cycles through each user in the tenant and applies the changes one-by-one.

## 'Groups' Menu
The `GROUPS MENU` is presented alongside a list of all the groups in the tenant.

>  ***Note:** Microsoft also supports distribution groups and Mail-enabled security groups which cannot be managed or retrieved through Microsoft Graph.*

Groups functionality is limited in Cross Counter because the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module is limited in its scope. Not all 'groups' listed in the menu will be directly editable.

-  ### Enter the number listed next to the group to edit it
Leads to the `MEMBERS MENU` for the specified group
-  ### q
Returns to *Main Menu*

## 'Members' Menu
The `MEMBERS MENU` is accessible through the `GROUPS MENU` and is contxtual to a chosen group. It is presented alongside a list of members within the group.
- ### Enter the number listed next to the member...
Takes you to the *Edit User* page for the chosen group member. When you exit the user page, you will return to the Members menu.
- ### add
Presents a list of users who are not already in the group. Users can be added to the group from this list.
- ### remove
Refreshes the group's member list and enables you to pick a user to be removed from the group.
- ### q
Returns to *Groups Menu*

## 'New User' Menu
*CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT*

The `NEW USER` Menu is for on boarding a new user into the tenant. Azure AD/M365 Admin portals do not let you 'copy' an existing user the same way Active Directory does.

## 'List Users' Menu
This refreshes and re-displays the user list. Note that if changes are made to a user's display name- this may lead to changes in the list ordering (as it is organised alphabetically). Whenever you select a user from the user list,  the 'number' you input to do so is always relevant to the most recent time the user list has been refreshed and displayed.

This menu lets you list users by:
- [1] Name only
- [2] Name + Email
- [3] Name + Mobile Phone
- [4] Name + Job Title
- [5] Name + License(s)
