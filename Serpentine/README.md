# Serpentine

*Serpentine* is for skipping some steps when on boarding Mac devices.

At the moment it clears the Mac's dock and downloads/installs Chrome. Most of the other Man-Horse scripts come with some sort of CLI. *Serpentine* is made to be run directly off of github as a script with no user input.
